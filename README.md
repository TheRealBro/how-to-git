# how-to-git

This presentation was made due to the request of getting new team members of the infrastructure team a brief overview over git and the usage of our gitlab instance.


This presentation is based on [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) 
with a theme based on the [openSUSE branding guidelines](http://opensuse.github.io/branding-guidelines/).
